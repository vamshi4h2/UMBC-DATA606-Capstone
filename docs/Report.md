## 2. Background
### What is it about? 
This project aims to predict whether a product from an international e-commerce company will be delivered on time or not. It also analyzes various factors that impact delivery times and studies customer behavior patterns. By using machine learning techniques, this project seeks to identify key factors influencing timely deliveries and customer satisfaction.

### Why does it matter? 
Timely delivery is a critical factor for customer satisfaction in the e-commerce industry. Late deliveries can result in negative customer experiences, loss of sales, and damage to the companyâ€™s reputation. By predicting the likelihood of late deliveries, the company can proactively address logistics challenges, optimize operations, and improve customer satisfaction. Additionally, understanding customer behavior and the factors affecting delivery efficiency can provide valuable insights for decision-making.

### Research Questions:
1. What are the primary factors influencing whether a product reaches its destination on time?
2. Can machine learning models effectively predict product delivery outcomes based on customer and shipment data?
3. How can the company optimize its logistics processes to minimize delays?
